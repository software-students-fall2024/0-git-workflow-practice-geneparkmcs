Understanding of Neural Networks from Scratch
This Neural Network article by Aditya talks about how neural networks are the powerful tools for deep learning. If applied with proper data and computing resources, they could solve most of the complex problems. It is pretty easy to treat them as a singular function, but it's more exciting to go behind the mechanics of such models. Aditya walks one through the core components of building a basic neural network using Python and NumPy, steering clear of deep learning libraries in favor of educational purposes.

The process starts from the initialization of the neural network parameters, which are weights and biases, followed by the forward propagation algorithm aimed at making predictions. The cost function represents some sort of gauge of error between predictions and actual values, while backpropagation serves to update weights through algorithms such as gradient descent, which minimize the cost function. Using these tools, the network is iteratively trained to improve its performance. Finally, there is provided code as an example.
